# OOP

A way to model real world objects as software objects that contain data and code.

## Encapsulation

- The bundling behavior and attributes on a single object
- Hiding fields or methods from public access

## Classes

Mold that instantiates object

- can be organized into logical groupings which are called packages

## Access Modifiers

- public - Any other classes in any package can access this class
- when the access modifiers is omitted it acts as protected
- protected - access the same package and any sub classes in any other package
- private - no other can access

## Objects

These contain attributes and behaviors

- class is a way to create the blue print or mold for creating the object
- attributes are stored in fields
- behaviors are exposed in methods
